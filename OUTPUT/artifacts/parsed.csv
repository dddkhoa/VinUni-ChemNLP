In addition, the acquired catalyst manifests excellent photocatalytic degradation for several other dyes including phenol red, methyl orange, and Congo red. 1. Introduction Metal oxide semiconductors are widely used for photocata- lytic degradation of organic pollutants due to their high photosensitivity, nontoxic nature, and low cost. It is well known that titanium oxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) can only be excited for photocatalysis. ZnO belongs to the n-type semiconductor and is considered one of the important semiconductor photocatalysts due to its high photosensitivity and stability [1, 2]. However, the constraint of ZnO among others is that it absorbs light only in the near UV region because of its large bandwidth of 3.2 eV. Unfortunately, sunlight constitutes only 4–5% of UV light [3, 4]. Therefore, the eﬀective use of solar energy still remains a challenge in photocatalytic application. The photoresponse of narrow- band-gap semiconductors shifts much more to the visible wavelength range",239
/Users/kaiser/code/chemnlp/v1/INPUT/test2.pdf,1,4,". However, these semiconductors are diﬃ- cult to maintain their photoactivity for a long time due to the recombination of the photo-induced electron-hole pairs. To improve the visible-light-driven photocatalytic eﬃciency of ZnO, some metals or oxides are often introduced to its sur- face. Au-loaded ZnO can signiﬁcantly enhance the activities of photogenerated electrons by suppressing the recombina- tion of charge carriers [5]. Unlike pure ZnO, mesoporous Fe2O3/ZnO core-shell composites manifest an excellent pho- tocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B in both ultraviolet and visible light regions [6]. The nanostructure of cupric oxide (CuO) is the p-type semiconductor with a narrow band gap of 1.2–2.71 eV. Despite its high capacity of absorption in the visible light range, CuO is surprisingly not appealing in terms of catalytic behavior due to its fast recombination rate of the induced electron-hole pairs. Thus, in order to Hindawi Journal of Nanomaterials Volume 2019, Article ID 5198045, 16 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/519804",264
/Users/kaiser/code/chemnlp/v1/INPUT/test2.pdf,2,1,"achieve a high catalytic activity, a synergistic system may be expected by connecting CuO with ZnO, in which CuO acts as a cocatalyst and thus expands the visible- light response. Moreover, the possible formation of favorable p-n junctions at the nanostructure interface restrains the photo-induced carrier recombination. Various approaches have been accomplished to synthesize ZnO/CuO composites for photocatalytic application such as sol-gel and coprecipita- tion [7–9]. However, to achieve a high degree of homoge- neous dispersion of each component still remains a major challenge with multimetal oxides. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crys- talline materials that have coordination bonds between transition-metal cations and organic ligands. The metal- organic frameworks possess unique performance advantages, such as controllable pore size and pore surface, low density, and large surface area. These outstanding properties make MOFs widely used in many ﬁelds, for example, adsorption, photocatalysis, and biosensors [10–12]. HKUST-1 (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) is one of the ﬁrst MOFs made up of copper nodes with benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylic (BTC) acid struts between them [13]. HKUST- 1 (or MOF-199 or Cu-BTC) manifests remarkable potentials in photocatalysis [14, 15] and separation [16]. MOF-199 notably displays persistence in both water and air [13]. Zinc is a promising metal that constructs an isostructural analogue to Cu-BTC. Anbia et al. [17] reported the hydrothermal ",359
/Users/kaiser/code/chemnlp/v1/INPUT/test2.pdf,2,2,"syn- thesis of Zn-BTC that can be a good material for hydrogen storage at room temperature. Zn-BTC is also synthesized through direct precipitation in solution under ultrasonic con- dition [18]. Xu et al. [19] reported the ionothermal synthesis of Zn-BTC using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ionic liquid as a solvent. The use of ionic liquid in the synthe- sis of Zn-BTC has shown a vast range of possibilities of controlling the structures and obtaining new materials by tuning the properties of the ionic liquid. Zn-BTC possesses lower-than-expected surface areas (a few meters to a few dozen meters), or it completely collapses upon the removal of guest molecules [20]. Generally, synthetic conditions (temperature, atmosphere, and posttreatment) are critical to the formation of MOF diﬀractions as well as their physico- chemical properties [17, 18, 21]. Multimetal component MOFs have widely been synthe- sized by simultaneously mixing several metal species with organic ligands [22, 23]. There exist several advantages of using multimetal-component MOFs as sacriﬁcial templates compared with other conventional templates [24]. They are as follows: (i) The metal species in MOFs are mixed at molecular levels (ii) Homogeneous morphologies of MOFs are critical regarding the preparation of anisotropic multimetal oxides that are diﬃcult to fabricate using classical methods (iii) Undesired aggregation or structural collapse of the framework during thermolysis can be minimized due to their structural strength Xu e",341

Huang et al. reported hierarchical NiFe2O4/Fe2O3 nanotubes prepared from MOFs for superior lithium-ion batteries [26]. Wu et al. developed a facile method for the synthesis of a hybrid ZnxCo(3–x)O4 composite via the thermal oxidative decomposition of bime- tallic (Zn/Co) zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) [27]. Recently, Lei et al. demonstrated the hollow CuO/ZnO materials derived from zeolite imidazole framework-8. This material is a very promising photocatalyst for tetracycline degradation [28]. However, so far, little work has been carried out to prepare ZnO/CuO from MOFs. In the present paper, a porous octahedral (ZnO/CuO) composite is synthesized from zinc/copper-based metal- organic framework-199, and its applications in visible-light- driven photocatalytic degradation of dyes are demonstrated. The precursors of Zn-BTC, Cu-BTC, and Zn/Cu-BTC are synthesized with a microwave-assisted method. In addition, pure Zn-BTC and Cu-BTC are prepared for the sake of comparison. Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acts as a sacriﬁcial template and is removed by calcination. The kinetic model of photocatalytic degradation is proposed by combining the heterogeneous catalysis for unimolecular reactions with adsorption isotherms. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials.

Dimethylformamide ((CH3)2NCHO), ethanol (C2H5OH), methanol (CH3OH, 99% purity), and methylene blue (C16H18ClN3S, 82%—MB) were acquired from HiMedia, India. Methylene blue is used as the dye model. Potassium iodide and benzoquinone are used as scavengers in the current study. 2.2. Apparatus. Powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns (PXRD) were performed on a D8 Advance Bruker monochromator equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1:5406 Å). The morphologies of the obtained samples were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S- 4800) and a high-resolution transmission electron micro- scope (HR-TEM) (JEM-2100). Thermo analysis (TG-DTA) was carried out using a TG-DTA instrument (DTG-60H Shimadzu) under atmospheric pressure at a heating rate of 10°C·min–1. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The samples (200 mg) were degassed at 120°C for 24h before measurements. The speciﬁc surface area was determined via the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model with a relative pressure of 0.01–0.25 using adsorption data. Pore size distri- bution calculation was accomplished with the BJH (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda) model using the adsorption branch of 2 Journal of Nanomateri",482

The data of ultraviolet-visible diﬀuse reﬂec- tance spectroscopy (UV-Vis-DRS) were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV-Vis spectrometer (using BaSO4 as the reference) at a collection speed of 600 nm·min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded with a Kratos Analytical spectrometer. All binding energies were referenced to the contaminant C 1s peak (at 284.6 eV) of adventitious carbon. The elemental compositions of Zn and Cu were analyzed with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using ZEEnit 7000. The elemental analysis of C and H was performed using Elemental Analyzer EA3000. Photoluminescence spectra of the obtained materials were measured at room temperature with a photoluminescence spectrophotometer (Horiba FL3). The concentration of dyes was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (V-630 Jasco) at λmax 644 nm for methy- lene blue, 464 nm for methyl orange, 431 nm for phenol red, 500 nm for Congo red, and 270 nm for phenol. The degree of MB mineralization was calculated based on TOC (total organic carbon). The concentration of TOC was determined using a TOC analyzer (TOC-VCPH). 2.3.

The resultant mixture was then loaded into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask and placed in a hand-made micro- wave device (Sharp R-203VN-M with a power of 250 W) [29] and irradiated for 30 min. The solid was collected by centrifugation, washed with DMF three times, dried at 180°C for 8 h, and designated as Zn/Cu-BTC [29]. Zn-BTC and Cu-BTC were synthesized with the same procedure. Oxides (ZnO/CuO, ZnO, and CuO) were prepared by annealing Zn/Cu-BTC, Zn-BTC, and Cu-BTC at 500°C for 5 h at a heating rate of 5°C·min–1 under atmospheric pres- sure in an electric furnace (Vulcan 3-550 PD). The oxides were stored in a desiccator and used as a catalyst without any further treatment. 2.4. Photocatalytic Activity 2.4.1. Photocatalytic Performance. A beaker containing 500 mL of an aqueous suspension of MB (5–30 ppm) and 400 mg of catalyst was placed under a lamp bracket. The light source is a 160 W metal halide lamp (Philips) equipped with a wavelength cut-oﬀ ﬁlter (λ ≤ 420 nm) (or Philips, Actinic BL 18 W, λ = 365 nm).

Three millilitres of the suspension was withdrawn at a certain time interval and centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst. The concentration of MB in the obtained clear liquid was analyzed using a UV-Vis spectro- photometer at λ = 664 nm. Further, the concentration of MB during illumination was determined using the aforesaid steps. In the scavenging test, potassium iodide, benzoqui- none, and isopropanol were used as scavengers. A suspension of 100 mL MB (10 ppm) and 80 mg catalyst was ﬁrst stirred in the dark, and 1 mL of the scavenger solution (2:4 × 10−2 M) was then added to the mixture under illumination. 2.4.2. Kinetic Analysis. The photocatalytic dye degradation kinetic is often investigated according to the pseudo-ﬁrst- order kinetic model or the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model [30, 31] for heterogeneous catalysis as follows: ln C C0 = −k · t, ð1Þ where C0 and C are the initial concentration at time t (mg·L–1) and k is the rate constant (min−1). However, the experimental design often involves two consecutive steps of dark adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. The problem to discuss here is the concentra- tion C0 in equation (1): whether it is the initial concentration or the equilibrium concentration just before illumination (Ce). Both of t",315
/Users/kaiser/code/chemnlp/v1/INPUT/test2.pdf,3,4,"hem seem unreasonable because Ce, in this case, is not an independent variable, but it depends on the balance of the dye in the solution and the adsorbent. C0 is the initial concentration. However, as soon as the photocatalytic reaction occurs, the initial concentration is not C0 but Ce. Most studies have ignored this issue. In order to overcome this obstacle, a new kinetic model is proposed by combining the heterogeneous catalysis for unimolecular reactions with the adsorption isotherms. A heterogeneous catalyst ﬁrst adsorbs the dye molecule from the aqueous solution onto its surface and then catalyzes the reaction under irradiation (two steps).

For the ﬁrst step, the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe (mg·g−1) can be calculated according to qe = V · C0 − Ce m , ð4Þ where C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium dye concentrations (mg·L−1); V and m are the solution volume (L) and mass of catalyst (g), respectively. Further, Ce and qe are related following the Langmuir isotherm. qe = qm · KL · Ce 1 + KL · Ce , ð5Þ 3 Journal of Nanomateri",347

Therefore, equation (6) can be rewritten as r = kr · KL · C 1 + KL · C = − dC dt : ð7Þ Now, integrating equation (7) with the boundary condi- tions of C = Ce at t = 0 min (subtracted the time required for saturated adsorption) and C = C at t = t. 1 KL · ln C + C = −kr · t + 1 KL · ln Ce + Ce: ð8Þ The values of kr can be obtained from the slope of the linear plot (ð1/KLÞ · ln C + C) vs. t. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Synthesis of the Porous Octahedral ZnO/CuO Composite from Zn/Cu-BTC. The compositional phase of the as- prepared materials is investigated using XRD (Figure 1). The reﬂection peaks of Cu-BTC appear as (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (420), (422), (511), (440), (600), (444), (511), (553), and (751) [32, 33], which indicates that the obtained Cu-BTC is MOF-199 with a space group of Fm3m [13]. Zn-BTC can exist in d",401

The XRD pattern of the prepared Zn-BTC is consistent with that of Zn-BTC synthesized with the microwave-assisted method [21] but is diﬀerent from that synthesized from Zn(CH3COO) with the solvothermal method [17] and with the ultrasound-assisted method [18]. The XRD patterns of Zn/Cu-BTC are consistent with those of Cu-BTC with a characteristic peak of Zn-BTC at 10.5°, indicating that Zn/Cu-BTC is constituted from Cu-BTC and Zn-BTC. The thermal behaviors of BTC compounds are studied via TG-DTA (Figure 2). For Zn-BTC and Cu-BTC, an exo- thermic peak appears at around 472 and 327°C, respectively, accompanied by large weight losses (approximately 42 and 39%), which is attributed to the combustion of BTC in the compounds (see Table S1). The complete decomposition temperature is around 470°C for Cu-BTC (400°C reported by reference [34], 670°C reported by reference [35]) and 500°C for Zn-BTC. In the case of Zn/Cu-BTC, an endothermic peak at 100°C with a weight loss of approximately 27% is assigned to the evaporation of the physically adsorbed water. Two exothermic peaks at 334 and 387°C with a weight loss of around 47% are due to the decompositio",324

The complete decomposition of Zn/Cu-BTC also takes place at around 500°C, and therefore, this temperature is selected to calcinate the precursors to obtain the oxides. During the calcination for 5 hours, hexagonal wurtzite ZnO, monoclinic CuO (JCPDS card No. 48–1548 and 36– 1451, respectively), and bimetallic ZnO/CuO are formed (Figure 3). No unknown peaks are observed in the XRD dia- grams, indicating that pure single oxides and a bimetallic oxide (ZnO/CuO) are obtained. In addition, the presence of peak broadening reveals that a grain reﬁnement occurs in ZnO/CuO possibly due to the formation of heterojunction structures. The average particle size of ZnO and CuO in the octahedral ZnO/CuO nanocomposite is ∼44 nm and ∼23 nm (calculated using Scherrer’s equation from the line broadening of (101) and (111) diﬀraction peak for ZnO and CuO, respectively). Figure 4 displays the morphologies of the as-prepared materials before and after calcination. Cu-BTC yields smooth octahedral crystals of ~10μm size (Figure 4(a1)); however, during calcination, the structural framework of Cu-BTC collapses to form irregular particles (Figure 4(a2)). To prevent this collapse, th",337

Zn-BTC comprises nanorods of diameter ~200 nm (Figure 4(b1)), and after calcination, they yield in ZnO nanoﬁbers (consisted of nanoparticles of 30~50 nm size) (Figure 4(b2)). As for Zn/Cu-BTC, octahedral particles with ﬂocculent substances (Zn-BTC) on the crystal surface are formed (Figure 4(c1)). Bimetallic ZnO/CuO octahedrons of diameter 5–10 μm remain unaltered after calcination (Figure 4(c2)). The TEM images show that ZnO/CuO octahedrons comprise nanoparticles of ~50 nm size (Figure 4(d1)). On the HR-TEM images of ZnO/CuO, it can be seen that the interplanar spacing of lattice fringes is 0.232 nm (corresponding to the (111) plane of monoclinic CuO (JCPDS card No. 48–1548)) and 0.281 nm (corresponding to the (100) plane of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS card No. 36–1451)). Hence, the intragranular location of both oxide phases could enhance the eﬃciency of semiconductor coupling eﬀects. 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 Zn/Cu-BTC Intensity (arb.) 2 theta (degree) Zn-BTC Cu-BTC (553) (751) (551) (444) (600) (440) (422) (511) (420) (311) (331) (400) (200) (222) (220) 200 cps Figure 1: XRD patterns of Cu-BTC, Zn-BTC, and Zn/Cu-BTC. 4 Journal of Nanomateri",427

The XPS spectrum of Cu has a doublet of Cu2p3/2 (at 933 eV) and Cu2p1/2 (at 952 eV) along with other satellite peaks at higher binding energies [39] (Figure 6(b)). Both peaks are very typical for the XPS spectrum of",330

Therefore, it can be inferred that ZnO/CuO is a compound containing Zn (II), Cu (II), and O. The band gap energies (Eg) of ZnO, CuO, and ZnO/CuO are calculated using UV-Vis-DRS measured at room temper- ature (Figure 7(a)). ZnO exhibits an absorption band with wavelengths of 350–390 nm (band gaps of 3.5–3.2 eV) in the ultraviolet region. CuO manifests a broad peak in the visible light region. The characteristic absorption bands of ZnO and CuO are observed in the spectrum of ZnO/CuO. The absorp- tion band of CuO shifts toward shorter wavelengths and integrates with the absorption band of ZnO, signifying that the band edges of p-type CuO and n-type ZnO are well- matched [8]. Tauc’s plot [42] is illustrated in Figure 7(b). The Eg values of ZnO and CuO are 3.19 eV and 1.94 eV, respectively (previously reported as 3.2–3.3 eV for ZnO [43, 44] and 1.4–1.85 eV for CuO [44–46]) (see Table S3). ZnO/CuO has an Eg value of 2.63 eV, manifesting a remarkable shift toward the longer wavelength regi",366

The maximum PL intensity is at 387.4 nm for CuO and 510.2 nm for ZnO. However, the PL intensity of ZnO/CuO composite is signiﬁcantly weaker than those of the CuO and ZnO. It is well known that low PL intensity means low recombination of electron and holes, then the opposite would be high PL intensity would increase recom- bination rate and reduce photocatalytic activity. These results demonstrate that the combinations ZnO and CuO have reduced the recombination of photonic electrons and photogenic holes, which may increase the photocatalytic activity of the material. 3.2.

However, the decoloriza- tion eﬃciency of Cu-BTC decreases to 41–50% after 60 min of UV/Vis irradiation. This indicates that desorp- tion occurs during irradiation. Zn-BTC exhibits weak photocatalytic activity upon UV or Vis irradiation and yields a decolorization eﬃciency of ~50% after 420 min of UV illumination and 38% after 420 min of Vis irradia- tion. This may be due to its very low surface area which decreases the number of active sites for MB to adsorb and decompose.

Mean- while, ZnO (UV) and ZnO (Vis) decolorize MB up to 95 and 90%, respectively, after 240 min of illumination. The ZnO/CuO composite also catalyzes MB degradation faster than pure CuO or ZnO under visible light illumination. In fact, after 120 minutes, its decolorization eﬃciency is 1.57 and 7.7 times as high as that of ZnO and CuO, respectively. The porous ZnO/CuO composite with a large surface area would provide the heterojunction structure and an eﬀective environment for a larger number of surface active sites. This increases MB–ZnO/CuO interaction and thus promoting photodegradation. In other words, the combination of ZnO and CuO causes the synergistic eﬀect in the catalytic degra- dation of methylene blue. 3.2.2. Eﬀect of pH and Leaching Experiment. Eﬀect of pH on decolorization of MB over ZnO/CuO catalyst is shown in Figure 10(a). The decolorization performance seems to be unchangeable in pH range from 2 to 7 and increases signiﬁ- cantly when pH increases. The point of zero charge (pHpzc) for ZnO/CuO, determined using the pH drift method, is around 7.9 (Figure 10(b)) [47]. At lower pH (lower than pHpzc), the surface of ZnO/CuO is positively charged. When pH increases from 2 to 7, the surface becomes less positive and the decolorization eﬃciency incr",395
/Users/kaiser/code/chemnlp/v1/INPUT/test2.pdf,9,2,"eases slightly. At higher pH (higher than pHpzc), the surface of ZnO/CuO is nega- tively charged; hence, MB and the catalyst attract each other through electrostatic interaction; thus, the decolorization eﬃciency increases signiﬁcantly. During the leaching experiment, the catalyst was ﬁltered after 30 min and the decolorization of MB under illumination almost stops (Figure 10(c)). In addition, the decolorization of MB without the catalyst is not observed after 70 min of illumination, indicating that MB is stable in the visible light region. Therefore, it can be inferred that ZnO/CuO acts as a heterogeneous catalyst in the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. 3.2.3. Visible-Light-Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of MB with ZnO/CuO Composite. The absorption bands at 292 nm and at 664 nm on the UV-Vis absorption spectra of MB can be attributed to the benzene ring and the con- junction color group –N=N–, respectively (Figure 11(a)). The intensity of these bands decreases with the increas- ing illumination time, and they almost disappear after 90 min of the reaction. The decolorization of MB occurs due to the disappearance of the color conjunction group during illumination. The TOC test also proves the mineralization of MB during photocatalytic degradation (Figure 11(b)). The TOC of MB reduces signiﬁcantly from 6.35 mg·L−1 for initial solution to 0.72 mg·L−1 aft",343
/Users/kaiser/code/chemnlp/v1/INPUT/test2.pdf,9,3,"er 140 min of illumination, indicating complete mineralization of MB over ZnO/CuO composite. In order to clarify the radical mechanism of the degra- dation reaction, three radical scavengers (KI for electron holes, isopropanol for ⋅OH, and benzoquinone for O2⋅–) were used in the present experiment. It is evident that the addition of isopropanol causes a moderate reduction in photocatalytic activity, while KI practically impedes the photocatalytic degradation of MB (Figure 12). Benzo- quinone hinders degradation by around 50%. This infers that electron holes and superoxides play an important role in MB degradation. A mechanism of photocatalysis on a semiconductor is employed to explain the photocatalytic activities in the visible light region. Since the band gap positions for the conduction band of CuO and ZnO are −0.43 eV and −0.15 eV vs. NHE, respectively [9, 48], and the band gaps of CuO and ZnO are 1.94 and 3.19 eV, then the band gap positions for valence bands are 1.51 eV for CuO and 3.04 eV for ZnO (see Table S3). Due to the strong light adsorption capacity of CuO in the visible light region, electrons are excited from VB to CB to form photogenerated h+/e– pairs. The position of CB in CuO is more negative than that in ZnO; hence, the transfer of the excited electrons to ECB (ZnO) prevents the fast recombination of photoexcited e–/h+ pairs (equations (9) and (10)",367
/Users/kaiser/code/chemnlp/v1/INPUT/test2.pdf,9,4,"). On the other hand, the state of MB (1.17 eV) could be excited to MB∗ (−0.69 eV) by visible light [49, 50] (equation (11)). The work function of the photoexcited MB∗ (−0.69 eV) is more negative than that of CuO and ZnO [49, 50]. MB acts as the photosensitizer to provide additional photogenerated electrons into CBs of CuO and ZnO through the formed downstream channel (equations (12) and (13)). The VB potential for CuO (1.51 eV) is more positive than that of MB (1.17 eV); therefore, h+ could easily oxidize MB to form degradation products (equation (14)). On the other hand, the CB edge position of CuO (−0.43 eV) is more negative than that of E0 (O2/O2 ⋅−) (−0.33 eV) [51]; thus, electrons on the conduction band of CuO reacts with O2 to produce superoxide radical O2 ⋅, which could substantially oxidize MB to form degradation products (equations (15) and (16)). In principle, h+ (1.51 eV) could not oxidize H2O (EðH2O/⋅OHÞ = 2:6 eV), but the experimental result still indicates the role of ⋅OH in the oxygenation of dye as shown in Figure 12. This is still a challenging problem possibly due to the deviation between theoretical and practical estimation.

Vapor phase polymerization (VPP), which is a site-specific gas-phase polymerization occurring at open metal sites of MOFs, was first employed to prepare morphology- and crystallinity-preserved polymer@MOF composites, which were then subjected to thermolysis to obtain M/MO@C composites. The polymer content used for VPP was directly related to the M/MO/MC nanoparticle weight content as well as the porosity of the carbon framework. In addition, crucial factors governing the crystallinity of final M/MO/MC nanoparticles were clearly classified in terms of the standard reduction potential of metal nodes and thermodynamic calculation for carbothermic reduction and carbide formation. To identify the advantages of morphology-preserved and content- and porosity-optimized MO@C composites for electrochemical applications, a series of CuO@C samples and CuO obtained from the direct oxidation of MOFs were tested as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

Introduction Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are porous crystalline materials composed of metal nodes and organic linkers, have been widely utilized as precursors for constructing hybrid metal materials (e.g., metal/metal oxide) and carbonaceous materials.1,2 The regular arrangement of metal nodes in MOFs can easily be transformed to metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (M/MO) through thermolysis and organic struts can be turned into a carbonaceous framework simultaneously, eventually produ- cing metal/metal oxide nanoparticles within a carbon framework (M/MO@C). Nano-sized metal species spatially arranged within a carbon matrix (CM) have attracted considerable interest for electrochemical applications such as supercapacitors,3–6 lithium- ion batteries (LIBs),6–10 and fuel cells.11–13 To achieve high-performance MOF-derived M/MO@C com- posites for electrochemical applications, the ability to tune the content, crystallinity, and size of M/MO as well as the porosity of the CM while preserving the morphology of the parent MOFs used is highly necessary.

For example, Xia et al. synthesized ZIF-67 of various sizes (from micro- meters to nanometers) and then subjected them to thermolysis under inert conditions to form Co@C composites.11 Co@C derived smaller MOF precursors presented higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities due to the larger exposed catalytic surface. Yang et al. reported MOF-5-derived ZnO quantum dots with a diameter of around 3.5 nm decorated in a porous carbon framework; the structure exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance as an anode material for LIBs.17 Lee et al. reported the control of oxidation states of MOF-derived manganese oxides with identical textural properties by controlling the thermolysis conditions; these oxides could be utilized as electrocatalysts for proving oxidation state-dependent ORR activity.18 In addition, the utilization of aliphatic ligands has resulted in controlled porosity in nanoporous metal oxide nanocrystals formed by thermolysis.17 Highly porous carbonaceous materials can be easily obtained from Zn-containing MOFs via thermolysis; here in situ Zn metal obtained from the carbothermic reduction of ZnO (ZnO(s) + C(s) - Zn(s) + CO(g)) vaporize",394

Cho’s group reported a Fe2O3 composite derived from MIL-88-Fe via a two-step thermolysis process: first, MIL-101 was heat-treated under N2 at 500 1C to obtain FeOx@C, which was then con- verted to morphology-preserved Fe2O3 by oxidation at 380 1C.25 The spindle-like mesoporous Fe2O3 particles presented ultra- high capacitance as anode materials for LIBs. Ni/NiO@graphene composites were synthesized from Ni-based MOF, wherein Ni@graphene was first prepared by heat treatment under inert condition at 450 1C, followed by oxidation at 200 1C to generated Ni/NiO@graphene composites, which could be used as anode materials for LIBs and sodium-ion batteries.8 Xia et al. synthesized ZIF-67 inside a mesoporous CM, which was then subjected to a two-step heat treatment to form Co@CO3O4@CM composites; in these composites, the mesoporous carbon template facilitated mass transport, resulting in superior ORR activity.26 Although fine-controlled MO and M/MO@C composites have shown promising electrochemical performance, a facile synthesis method combining all the aforementioned features is yet to be reported. In this regard, we have recently repor",406

Phenol formaldehyde (PF) was vaporized and polymerized at two open Cu catalytic sites regularly spaced for every secondary building unit.27 Crystallinity- and morphology-preserved PF@Cu-HKUST-1 was successfully achieved by vapor phase polymerization (VPP) and was then subjected to thermolysis to form Cu@C composites. CuO/Cu2O@C composites were subsequently obtained by controlling of oxidation process. The size of the Cu@C particles could be easily adjusted by varying the carbonization conditions, and the amount of PF used for VPP was directly related to the Cu/CuO/Cu2O nanoparticle content as well as the porosity of the carbon framework. In this study, we explored the utilization of VPP method for MOFs of diﬀerent metal sites with identical topology (M-HKUST-1, M: Cu and Zn, and M-MOF-74, M: Co, Fe, Mg) and MOF with small pore (3.4 Å, ZIF-8). The VPP of M-HKUST-1 (M: Cu and Zn) was successfully achieved, showing that site- specific polymerization can occur regardless of the metal center in the same topology. In addition, M-MOF-74 (M: Co, Fe, Mg) having a one-dimensional channel with a pore size of 10 Å was employed for VPP, resulting in morphology- and crystallinity- preserved PF@MOF-74 composites, thus confirming the applic- ability of VPP for MOFs with pore sizes larger than 10 Å. When ZIF-8 with a pore size of 3.4 Å was used for VPP, however, the morphology of ZIF-8 changed because of which phenol and formaldehyde cannot penetrate due to their narrow pore size. PF@M",443

The crystallinity was observed to vary depending on the reduction potential of the metal nodes and the carbothermic reduction reaction (MO + C - M + CO). Cu@C was obtained from Cu-KHUST-1, whereas Zn-HKUST-1 was transformed to ZnO@C initially and morphology- preserved carbon was eventually formed. For M-MOF-74, MgO@C was produced from Mg-MOF-74; on the other hand, Fe2O3@C was formed below 450 1C and Fe@graphite (Fe@G) and Fe3C@G were finally produced from Fe-MOF-74 by prolonged high- temperature thermolysis. Similar trends were observed for Co-MOF-74; Co3O4@C was formed initially and Co/CoO@C was finally produced at higher temperatures. In addition, the porosity and content of M/MO/MC@C/G composites could be easily tuned by adjusting the amount of PF precursor. Furthermore, morphology-preserved and content- and porosity- optimized CuO@C composite was tested as an anode material for LIBs and were found to exhibit better electrochemical performance than less-optimized samples and CuO obtained from the direct oxidation of the parent MOF, and outstanding long-term stability with a remarkable specific capacity of 410 mA h g1 after 1000 cycles at a rate of 1000 mA g1.

Combined all characterization results including XRD, SEM, and N2 sorption and TGA measurements, it should be clear that VPP occurred at the open metal catalytic sites located inside pores of MOFs, giving rise to shape-preserved and crystallinity-preserved PF@MOF composites. According to the pore sizes of HKUST-1 (14 Å) and MOF-74 (10 Å), it was considered that the vaporized PF molec",258

Thus, ZIF-8, which had pore size of 10.9 Å that was accessible through small apertures with diameters of 3.4 Å, was tested for VPP to identify the pore size eﬀect.33 According to the SEM investigations, polymerization occurred on the surface of the polyhedral morphology of ZIF-8 (Fig. S3, ESI†). It was reported that the extraordinary flexibility of the ZIF-8 framework allowed molecules with sizes of 4–6 Å to enter the apertures.34 Therefore, PF could enter the aperture of ZIF-8, but site-specific polymeriza- tion could not occur solely within the sodalite cage of ZIF-8. M/MO/MC@C composite PF@M-HKUST-1 (M: Cu and Zn) composites were first subjected to thermolysis under N2 atmosphere at diﬀerent temperatures. When PF@Cu-HKUST-1 was heat-treated at a relatively low temperature (380 1C), most of the XRD peaks corresponded to Cu, while a few XRD peaks corresponding to CuO appeared (Fig. S4, ESI",269

This was probably because the standard reduction potential (SRP) of Cu2+ to Cu (E1 = +0.337 V) was positive; hence, Cu was preferentially formed under higher thermolysis temperatures.27,35 According to the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 2a2 and inset), the polyhedral shape of the resulting Cu@C composite resembled the morphology of the pristine MOF and Cu nanoparticles were well distributed within carbon framework, confirming that the morphology of the parent MOF was fully preserved even after thermolysis at high temperature. To control the crystal phase from Cu to CuO, mild oxidation at 200 1C was performed under air for 12 h. After the oxidation, a crystallinity change from Cu@C to CuO@C was observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 2a1), without morphological change (Fig. 2a3, inset).

According to the Scherrer equation, the size of the Cu nanoparticles (60 nm) of Cu@C were much larger than that of the CuO nanoparticles (7.1 nm) of CuO@C. This was probably attributed to the stress- induced phase transformation from a cubic to a monoclinic unit cell,36–38 and it seemed that the kirkendall effect occurred during oxidation, resulting in void spaces between the CuO nanoparticles.39 Fig. 2 XRD patterns of M/MO@C obtained by thermolysis and oxidation (a1–d1).

It is widely accepted that carbothermic reduction (ZnO (s) + C (s) - Zn (s) + CO (g)) and subsequent vaporization of nano-sized metallic Zn proceeds at high temperatures (4900 1C).1,19–22 Further, it has been widely reported that morphology-preserved carbonaceous materials with a high surface area can be prepared using Zn-containing MOFs; these materials can be used as CO2 sorbents, electrocatalysts for ORR, and supercapacitors.17,22–24 According to the SEM image (Fig. 2b2), the cubic morphology of Zn-HKUST-1 was preserved in ZnO@C, and nano-sized ZnO nanocrystals with a d-spacing of 0.261 nm for the crystal fringe of (101) could be clearly observed within the CM (Fig. 2b3).

According to XRD, crystalline MgO with a size of 3.2 nm was observed during the thermolysis of PF@Mg-MOF-74 at 800 1C (Fig. 2c1). Aggregated rods with sharp edges were observed by SEM and nano-sized MgO was embedded within the CM and the presence of polycrystalline MgO@C composites was confirmed by electron diﬀraction observations (Fig. 2c2, c3, and c3 inset). Meanwhile, PF@Co-MOF-74 was subjected to thermolysis at a relatively low temperature of 500 1C, resulting in mixed crystals of CoO/Co3O4/Co@C (Fig. 2d1). Major crystals observed were CoO; nevertheless, XRD peaks corresponding to Co3O4 and Co were also observed. When a high thermolysis temperature of 800 1C was applied, Co crystals were formed as the major product and the peaks corresponding to CoO crystals had very small intensities. It was believed that the carbothermic reduction of Co oxides to Co metal occurred during high temperature thermo- lysis (Co3O4 + C - 3Co + 4CO and CoO + C - Co + CO). As expected, the rod shape morphology of Co-MOF-74 was pre- served even after high-temperature treatment (Fig. 2d2), and TEM measurements showed the presence of Co nanocrystals spatially dist",359

When the composite was treated at a low temperature of 450 1C, only g-Fe2O3 nanocrystals with size of 4.5 nm (as determined by the Scherrer equation) were formed (Fig. 3a). When the thermolysis proceeded at 600 1C, metallic Fe with a size of ca. 60 nm was the only product (Fig. 3a); on the other hand, XRD patterns corresponding to Fe3C and Fe appeared when further thermolysis was performed at 800 1C (Fig. S6, ESI†). It was possible that the carbothermic reduction of g-Fe2O3 (g-Fe2O3 + C - 2Fe + 3CO) formed metallic Fe, which further underwent carbide formation to provide Fe3C at the higher temperature (800 1C).40 The crystallinity transformation will be discussed in detail in the next section. According to the SEM images, g-Fe2O3@C presented a smooth rod shape, identical to the parent Fe-MOF-74, thus confirming that the morphological feature of the pristine MOF was preserved after VPP and thermolysis (Fig. 3b). TEM inves- tigations clearly confirmed that tiny g-Fe2O3 nanocrystals with a size less than 5 nm and a crystalline fringe of (311) with a d-spacing of 0.251 nm were spatially distributed throughout the one-dimensional rod-shaped CM (",350

On the other hand, the SEM image of the Fe@C sample still showed a one- dimensional rod shape but clearly presented a rough surface with white dots, unlike the smooth surface of the g-Fe2O3@C sample (Fig. 3d). Further TEM investigation indicated the broad size distribution of Fe nanoparticles within the one- dimensional carbon rod (Fig. 3e). When we carefully observed the edges of the Fe@C composite, several hollow holes of diameters less than 50 nm were clearly observed and graphene layers with a thickness of around 10 nm formed hollow structures (d-spacing was measured as 0.34 nm; Fig. 3f and inset).

On the other hand, large Fe particles were wrapped with thicker graphene layers than the hollow structures (Fig. 3f and g). Graphene layers with thicknesses of around 20 nm were conformally coated on the shaped Fe nanoparticles and characteristic (110) crystalline planes with a d-spacing of 0.228 nm were clearly identified in the Fe nanoparticles (Fig. 3g and inset). To investigate the graphitic feature of Fe@C, the Fe compo- nent of the composite was selectively removed by acid treatment and XRD and Raman measurements were performed. According to the XRD results (Fig. S7, ESI†), a diﬀraction peak at ca. 261, corresponding to the (002) plane of the graphitic domain, clearly appeared, confirming that Fe nanoparticles catalyzed the for- mation of graphitic layers on the surface. In addition, the Raman spectrum showed a well-developed G band (ca. 1580 cm1) with an ID/IG ratio of 0.87 and a broad band ranging from 2500 to 2800 cm1, corresponding to the 2D band, which are charac- teristic features of sp2 graphitic materials (Fig. 3h).41 Therefore, the Fe@C sample is hereafter denoted as Fe@G.

First, the standard reduction potential (SPR) should be considered to be a pivotal factor governing the final crystallinity phase of the MOF- derived composites obtained by thermolysis under inert condi- tions. Das et al. reported that metal ions with an SRP higher than 0.27 V always presented pure metal nanoparticles, whereas those with an SRP lower than 0.27 V presented metal oxide nanoparticles, which were dispersed within a CM.40 Regarding this aspect, the SRP values of the metal ions used in this study, Mg2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Cu2+, were 2.69, 0.76, 0.44, 0.27, and 0.33 V, respectively (Table 1). Accord- ing to our results, the trend of products obtained by thermo- lysis under inert conditions was similar to that reported by Das et al., except for Co and Fe-MOF-74. CoO was a major product of the thermolysis performed at a temperature of 500 1C and transformed to Co nanocrystals when thermolysis was performed at a higher temperature of 800 1C (Fig. 2d1). In addition, g-Fe2O3 was first formed at a low thermolysis temperature of 450 1C and was transformed to Fe nanocrystals at 600 1C and Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals on further thermolysis at 800 1C (Fig. 3a and Fig. S6, ESI†). In this regard, another factor aﬀecting crystallinity change should be considered, which is carbothermic reduction. In this reaction, carbon is utilized as a reducing agent to reduce substances such as metal oxides; the reaction can generally be described as follows: MO(s) + C(s) - M(s) + CO(",420

For MgO, the value of free energy change was positive in for temperatures up to 1000 1C (Fig. 4a); MgO was the only product of thermolysis because of its very low SRP value of 2.69 V (Table 1). A similar trend was obtained for ZnO, but its free energy change was a very small positive value at high temperature. Accordingly, numerous studies reported the in situ formation of pure metallic Zn metal via the carbothermic reduction of ZnO@C, which eventually vaporizes to produce carbonaceous materials (Fig. 4b).1,19–22 The carbothermic reduction of Fe2O3 (2Fe2O3(s) + 3C(s) - 4Fe + 3CO2(g)) has been widely utilized for iron ore smelting.44 As expected, the free energy change for pure Fe nanocrystals was 697.5 kJ mol1 at 600 1C (Fig. 4c), which confirmed that g-Fe2O3 transformed to pure Fe nanoparticles after thermolysis at 600 1C (Fig. 3a). In addition, the free energy change for the carbothermic reduction of CoO (CoO(s) + C(s) - Co(s) + CO(g)) became negative just above 600 1C (Fig. 4d), which confirmed that CoO transformed to pure Co nanocrystals after thermolysis at a temperature of 8",435

Lastly, the free energy change for the carbothermic reduction of CuO (CuO(s) + C(s) - Cu(s) + CO(g)) showed a large negative value throughout the temperature range, suggesting that only pure Cu nanocrystals were formed after high-temperature treatment (Fig. 4e). The other factor aﬀecting the crystallinity was carbide formation. According to our results, the XRD patterns corres- ponding to Fe3C appeared after higher temperature (800 1C) thermolysis reaction. It was confirmed that Fe3C formation (3Fe(s) + C - Fe3C(s)) was favorable, as determined by the free energy change calculation (Fig. 4c). Textural features of M/MO@C composites Nitrogen sorption measurements were performed to obtain the textural features such as SSA, pore volume, and pore size distribution (PSD) of the as-prepared M/MO@C samples. Characteristic type I isotherms were observed for all Cu@C, ZnO@C, C derived from ZnO@C, MgO@C, g-Fe2O3@C, Fe@G, and Co/CoO@C samples, indicating that microporosity originated Table 1 Standard reduction potentials (SRPs) and final crystalline products of PF@MOF composites after thermolysis at various temperatures Sample Reduction potential (eV) Temperature (1C) Product PF@Cu-HKUST-1 +0.337 380 Cu/CuO@C 800 Cu@C PF@Zn-HKUST-1 0.76 600 ZnO@C 0.76 900 C PF@Mg-MOF-74 2.69 800 MgO@C PF@Co-MOF-74 0.27 500 Co/CoO/Co3O4@C 800 Co/CoO@C PF@Fe-MOF-74 0.44 450 g-Fe2O3@C 600 Fe@C 800 Fe/Fe3C@C Paper NJC Published on 19 October 2018.

On the other hands, the SSA, pore volume, and PSD of M/MO@C could be varied by varying the amount of PF precursor used for VPP, which simultaneously influenced the weight percentage of M or MO in the composites. First, Cu@C was prepared using diﬀerent PF amounts of 100% and 10%, denoted as Cu@C_100% and Cu@C_10%, respectively. Com- pared to Cu@C_100%, Cu@C_10% showed a combined type I and IV adsorption isotherm, representing microporosity and mesoporosity, respectively (Fig. 5a). Due to use of a small PF precursor amount in Cu@C_10%, a PSD centered at ca. 6.2 nm was developed; on the other hand, the SSA of Cu@C_10% was 426.26 m2 g1, reduced from 588.58 m2 g1 for Cu@C_100%, probably owing to the fewer carbon moieties in the composite (Fig. 5b and Table 2). In addition, the weight percentage of Cu for the Cu@C_100% and Cu@C_10% samples changed to 37.5 and 62.7 wt%, respectively, because of the use of a small PF precursor amount for Cu@C_10% (Fig. S12, ESI† and Table 2). In addition, CuO@C_100% and CuO@C_10% were prepared via mild oxidation of Cu@C_100% and Cu@C_10%. The resulting CuO@C_100% and _10% both represented type I isotherms, inferring that microporosity originating from the CM ",450

Inter- estingly, CuO@C_100% and _10% both samples also showed type IV isotherms, with PSDs centered at 15.9 nm and 24.43 nm, respectively (Fig. 5c and d). The mesoporosity of CuO@C_10% was reasonable because the parent Cu@C_10% already presented mesoporosity (Fig. 5b); on the other hand, the mesoporosity of CuO@C_100% was unexpected due to lack of mesoporosity in its parent sample. Notably, during oxidation, Cu nanoparticles with a size of ca. 60 nm were transformed into tiny CuO nanoparticles with size of around 4.5 nm (Fig. 2a2 and a3), and some void spaces were observed by TEM (Fig. 2a3). This was probably due to the reduced particle size induced by transformation from a cubic to a monoclinic unit cell as well by the formation of void spaces due to the Kirkendall eﬀect during oxidation,36–39 from which the mesoporosity of CuO@C_100% may have originated. In addition, the SSAs of CuO@C_100% and _10% were 478.66 and 228.06 m2 g1, respectively; the smaller SSA for CuO@C_10% could be attributed to the smaller CM, which was also confirmed by the TGA results of 39.1 wt% and 73.5 wt% of CuO, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. S13, ESI†). This process could be applied to other MOFs. For example, the textural features and weight percentage of g-Fe2O3@C were adjusted by varying the PF precursor amount during VPP. The g-Fe2O3@C_10% sample was prepared using 10% PF precursor, whereas g-Fe2O3@C, as already mentioned, is hereafter denoted as g-Fe2O3@C_100%. g-",454

Therefore, the SSA, micropore volume, and weight percentage of M or MO of the M/MO@C composites could be easily varied by adjusting the amount of PF precursor used during VPP; this is a useful method to fabricate advanced materials for various applications. Electrochemical performance Among the MOF-derived M/MO@C composites, CuO@C has been applied as anode materials for LIBs. CuO has been widely investigated as a next-generation anode material for LIBs because of its advantages over conventional graphite anode (theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g1) in terms of a high theoretical capacity of 674 mA h g1, relatively low cost, environmental friendliness, and other factors.14,25,45–50 These transitional metal oxides, however, suffer from several issues, including large volume changes, resulting in pulverization of the electrode material and eventually capacity fading during charge/discharge, and relatively low electrical conductivity, causing additional capacity fading, especially at high current densities.25,45 To overcome these issues, porous and conductive mater",396

Galvanostatic lithiation/delithiation of the CuO@C_100% and _10% samples and of CuO derived from the direct oxida- tion of Cu-HKUST-1 was first performed in a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (Fig. 6a) at a current density of 100 mA g1. CuO@C_10% presented first discharge and charge capacities of 1027 and 541.4 mA h g1, respectively, with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 52.7%, ascribed to the decomposition of the electrolyte, which eventually resulted in the irreversible Table 2 Textural properties of M/MO@C composites Sample SBET a (m2 g1) Vtot a (cm3 g1) Vmicro b (cm3 g1) M/MOc (wt%) Cu@C_100% 584.0 0.26 0.23 37.5 Cu@C_10% 422.7 0.35 0.12 62.7 CuO@C_100% 478.66 0.37 0.16 39.1 CuO@C_10% 228.06 0.35 0.04 73.5 ZnO@C 432 0.197 0.173 — C 1145 0.622 0.414 0 MgO@C 1255.9 0.67 0.54 34.7 Co/CoO/Co3O4@C 240 0.25 0.08 — Co/CoO@C 206 0.14 0.08 — g-Fe2O3@C_100% 174.32 0.11 0.06 44.5 g-Fe2O3@C_10% 95.5 0.067 0.039 58.3 Fe@C 357 0.23 0.12 — Fe/Fe3C@C 208 0.24 0.05 — a SSA and total pore volume obtained by BET method and at P/P0 = 0.99, respectively. b Calculated by the t-plot method. c Measured by TGA.

When considering the weight percentage of CuO (73.5 wt%, see Table 2) in CuO@C_10%, the capacity value was higher than theoretical capacity of 73.5% of CuO (672 mA h g1), which may be attributed to the lithium-ion storage capacity of the CM. CuO@C_10% exhibited a much higher capacity than CuO@C_100% (303.9 mA h g1 over 110 cycles) probably due to its well- defined mesoporosity and higher CuO content (Fig. 6a). In addition, the CuO@C_10% sample showed a",255

In addition, CuO@C_10% exhibited a good cycling stability and higher capacity values than CuO@C_100% at rapid charge/discharge rates of up to 5000 mA g1 and recovered a similar capacity value at a low current density of 100 mA h g1, indicating the excellent rate capability of the CuO@C_10% sample (Fig. 6b). The voltage profile for CuO@C_10% at 100 mA g1 was plotted in the Fig. 6c, showing that after 1st cycle, high coulombic eﬃciencies were well maintained up to 100 cycles. The long-term stability of CuO@C_10% was investigated at a rate of 1000 mA g1. The first discharge and charge capacities were 725.5 and 500.6 mA h g1, respecti",244

Meanwhile, the capacity continuously decreased to 358 mA h g1 until the 80th cycle, which could be attributed to the formation of the unstable SEI layer during high-rate charge/discharge (Fig. 6d). The specific capacity, however, increased up to 415 mA h g1 in the 450th cycle and was maintained until the 1000th cycle. Such remarkable long-term stability with outstanding specific capacity has rarely been achieved in anode materials composed of transi- tional metal oxides and probably originated from the structural integrity of the CuO@C composite, which consisted of spatially distributed CuO nanocrystals embedded within electrically conductive carbonaceous materials.

Site-specific gas-phase polymerization occurring at the open metal sites of MOFs with pore sizes larger than 10 Å was successfully achieved by VPP, providing morphology- and crystallinity-preserved PF@MOF composites. At this stage, the amount of PF precursor could be controlled, which was directly and simultaneously related to the porosity and content of the resulting M/MO@C composites after the thermolysis of PF@MOFs.

The crystallinity of M/MO@C was varied depending on the SRP of the metal nodes and carbothermic reduction reactions. An SRP greater than 0.27 V (Cu2+) formed Cu@C, but metal ions with an SRP lower than 0.76 V (Mg2+ and Zn2+) formed metal oxide nanoparticles (MgO@C and ZnO@C). In contrast, the SRP values of 0.44 and 0.27 for Fe2+ and Co2+, respectively, provided diﬀerent crystallinities depending on the thermolysis temperature; the major products for lower tem- perature (450–500 1C) thermolysis are were metal oxides (i.e., g-Fe2O3 and CoO), while those for high temperature thermo- lysis (600–800 1C) were metal and metal carbide@C (Fe, Fe3C, and Co). Such crystallinity transformation originated from carbothermic reduction and carbide formation during high temperature thermolysis. Furthermore, morphology-preserved and content- and porosity-optimized CuO@C composites were tested as anode materials for LIBs, and they exhibited superior electrochemical performance than less-optimized sample and CuO obtained from the direct oxidation of the parent MOF, and outstanding long-term stability with a remarkable specific capacity of 410 mA h g1 after 1000 cycles at a rate of 1000 mA g1.
